# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

The challenge fairly easy enough but yet some parts were challenging. I am really happy how it turned out. 

I will continue to progress on SCSS and HTML 5 semantic tags.


### Useful resources

- For the hover states, I used (https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/how-to-animate-box-shadow/) Tobias Ahlin's article about "animating box shadows with smooth performance".
